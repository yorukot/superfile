# What is superfile?
superfile is a modern terminal file manager crafted with a strong focus on user interface, functionality, and ease of use. Built with [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), it combines a visually appealing design with the simplicity of terminal tools, providing a fresh, accessible approach to file management.

# Why was superfile built?
Before creating superfile, I tried a lot of terminal file managers, but I was often disappointed by their UI design. So, I built superfile with a primary focus on delivering a refined, user-friendly interface.

# Why should I use superfile?
superfile is sleek and visually appealing, making it a great choice for lightweight file or directory tasks. While it may not be as feature-packed as some other terminal file managers, it excels in usability and design. If you’re looking for a full-featured file manager, I’d recommend tools like [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) or others. However, for straightforward tasks with a clean interface, superfile is an excellent option.
