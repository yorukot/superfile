You can edit your superfile config file with the following command:

```bash
$EDITOR config_path
```

:::tip
To see the path locations of your superfile files, use the command `spf pl`.
:::

### Setting

- ###### theme

[Click here](/configure/custom-theme) for instructions to edit the theme.

- ###### editor

The editor your files/directories will be opened with (if blank, it will default to the EDITOR environment variable).

- ###### auto_check_update

`true`  => Checks whether updates are needed when you exit superfile (only checks once a day).

`false` => No checks performed.

- ###### cd_on_quit

:::note
Doesn't work on Windows at the moment.
:::

`true` => When you exit superfile, changes the terminal path to the last file panel you used.

`false` => When you exit superfile, the terminal path remains the same prior to superfile.

After setting to `true`, you need to update your `.bashrc` file.

Open the file:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.bashrc
```

Copy the following code into the file:

<CodeBlock file="cd_on_quit/cd_on_quit.sh" />

Save, exit, and reload your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

- ###### default_open_file_preview

`true` => Shows the file preview window when you run superfile.

`false` => Hides the file preview window when you run a superfile.

- ###### file_size_use_si

`true` => Displays the file/directory sizes using powers of 1000 (kB, MB, GB).

`false` => Displays the file/directory sizes using powers of 1024 (KiB, MiB, GiB).

- ###### default_directory

The default location every time superfile is opened. Supports `~` and `.`

- ###### default_sort_type

File panel sorting type. Directories will always be displayed at the top.

`0` => Name

`1` => Size

`2` => Date Modified

- ###### sort_order_reversed

File panel sorting order.

`false` => Ascending (a-z)

`true` => Descending (z-a)

- ###### case_sensitive_sort

File panel sorting case sensitivity (if `true`, uppercase letters come before lowercase letters).

`true` => Case sensitive ("B" comes before "a")

`false` => Case insensitive ("a" comes before "B")

- ###### debug

Whether to enable debug mode. (if `true`, more verbose logs are written in log file).

`true` => DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR logs are written to log file

`false` => INFO, WARN, ERROR logs are written to log file

### Style

- ###### transparent_background

`true` => The background color is not rendered (transparent). This is useful if your terminal background is transparent.

`false` => The background is rendered (with color) to maintain theme consistency.

- ###### file_preview_width

This setting is an integer.

`0` => The width of the file preview window is the same as the file panel.

`X` => The width of the file preview window is 1/`X` of the terminal width (minus the sidebar width). It is calculated as: (terminal width - sidebar width) / `X`

:::caution
`X` must be from 2 to 10.
:::

- ###### sidebar_width

This setting is an integer.

`0` => The sidebar will not display.

`X` => The width of the sidebar.

:::caution
`X` must be from 3 to 20.
:::

```toml
# ...
border_top = "━"
border_bottom = "━"
border_left = "┃"
border_right = "┃"
border_top_left = "┏"
border_top_right = "┓"
border_bottom_left = "┗"
border_bottom_right = "┛"
border_middle_left = "┣"
border_middle_right = "┫"
#...
```

```toml
# ...
border_top = "─"
border_bottom = "─"
border_left = "│"
border_right = "│"
border_top_left = "╭"
border_top_right = "╮"
border_bottom_left = "╰"
border_bottom_right = "╯"
border_middle_left = "├"
border_middle_right = "┤"
#...
```
