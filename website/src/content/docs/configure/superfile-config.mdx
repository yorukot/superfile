You can enter the following command to set it up;

```bash
$EDITOR config_path
```

:::tip
If you want to get the set path you can try `spf pl` which will print out the file locations of all superfile.
:::

### Setting

- ###### theme
You can go to [here](/configure/custom-theme) to know how to config it

- ###### auto_check_update
`true`  => Turning on will check whether updates are needed every time superfile is closed (only checked once a day)

`false` => If closed, no checks will be performed

- ###### cd_on_quit
`true` => Every time you exit superfile, it will navigate the path of the terminal to the path of the last file panel you used.

`false` => Nothing happen

If you want to open this feature you need to copy the code into `~/.bashrc`

:::note
This doesn't work on windows at the moment.
:::

<CodeBlock file="cd_on_quit/cd_on_quit.sh" />

and reload ~/.bashrc

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

- ###### default_open_file_preview
`true` =>  The file preview panel opens automatically every time you open superfile.

`false` => The file preview panel will not open automatically when you open a superfile.

- ###### file_size_use_si
`true` => The file/directory sizes will be displayed using powers of 1000 (kB, MB, GB).

`false` => The file/directory sizes will be displayed using powers of 1024 (KiB, MiB, GiB).

### Style

- ###### transparent_background
`true` => If enabled, the background color will not be rendered (transparent). This is useful if your terminal background is transparent.

`false` => If turned off, the background will be rendered (with color) to maintain theme consistency.

- ###### file_preview_width
This setting is an integer.

`0` => When it is 0, it means that the width of the File preview panel will be the same as that of the File panel.

`X` => When it is any other number, it means that the width of the File preview panel will be the width of the entire panel (total width of the terminal - width of the sidebar) divided by X.

:::caution
The number of entries must be from 2 to 10
:::

- ###### sidebar_width
This setting is an integer.

`0` => If the number is 0 then the sidebar will not display.

`X` => This number will be the width of the sidebar width.

:::caution
Figures must be 3-20
:::

- ###### Border style

```toml
# ...
border_top = "━"
border_bottom = "━"
border_left = "┃"
border_right = "┃"
border_top_left = "┏"
border_top_right = "┓"
border_bottom_left = "┗"
border_bottom_right = "┛"
border_middle_left = "┣"
border_middle_right = "┫"
#...
```

```toml
# ...
border_top = "─"
border_bottom = "─"
border_left = "│"
border_right = "│"
border_top_left = "╭"
border_top_right = "╮"
border_bottom_left = "╰"
border_bottom_right = "╯"
border_middle_left = "├"
border_middle_right = "┤"
#...
