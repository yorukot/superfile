You can edit your superfile config file with the following command:

```bash
$EDITOR config_path
```

:::tip
To see the path locations of your superfile files, use the command `spf pl`.
:::

### Setting

- ###### theme

[Click here](/configure/custom-theme) for instructions to edit the theme.

- ###### editor

The editor your files will be opened with (Leave blank to use the EDITOR environment variable. If EDITOR environment variable is not set, it will default to `nano` for MacOS/Linux, and `notepad` for Windows.

- ###### dir_editor

The editor your directories will be opened with (Leave blank to use defaults : `vi` - Linux, `open` - MacOS, `explorer` - Windows).

- ###### auto_check_update

`true`  => Checks whether updates are needed when you exit superfile (only checks once a day).

`false` => No checks performed.

- ###### cd_on_quit

`true` => When you exit superfile, changes the terminal path to the last file panel you used.

`false` => When you exit superfile, the terminal path remains the same prior to superfile.

After setting to `true`, you need to update your shell config file. Sample changes :

##### MacOS/Linux (bash or fish)

###### Bash

Open the file:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.bashrc
```

Copy the following code into the file:

<CodeBlock file="cd_on_quit/cd_on_quit.sh" />

Save, exit, and reload your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

###### Fish

Open the file:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

If you suspect your `config.fish` file is located somewhere else, read [the Fish shell documentation](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#configuration)

Copy the following code into the file:

<CodeBlock file="cd_on_quit/cd_on_quit.fish" />

Save, exit, and reload `config.fish`:

```bash
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

##### Windows (Powershell)

Open the file:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

Copy the following code into the file:

<CodeBlock file="cd_on_quit/cd_on_quit.ps1" />

Save, exit, and reload your profile.

```powershell
. $PROFILE
```

:::note
You need to make sure powershell is allowed to execute script. If you get error like `running
scripts is disabled on this system`. You need to allow it.
